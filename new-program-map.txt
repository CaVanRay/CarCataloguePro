This is the layout for the new CarCataloguePro, I'm going to plan out a cleaner more intuitive outline here before I just start opening files 

 ----- .CPP files -----

**main.cpp**:
  - main()            - starts and organizes everything

**menu.cpp** (might delete later):
  - optionsMenu()     - (Used to select what function to run) (need to simplify further)

**printer.cpp** (functions for printing and displaying?):
  - printCatalogue()  - (Runs through current vector list and displays them all on screen)
  - printCar()        - (Searches for car by index and displays on screen)

**toolFuncs** (functions used by other functions?):
  - findCar()         - (Searches for car by index)(Returns pointer to car) **This is a function mostly called by other functions**

**crudFuncs** (CRUD functions):
