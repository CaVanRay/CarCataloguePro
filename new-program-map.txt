This is the layout for the new CarCataloguePro, I'm going to plan out a cleaner more intuitive outline here before I just start opening files 

 ----- .CPP files -----

**main.cpp**
  - main()            - starts and organizes everything

**UsePuts.cpp (tools for user in/output):** (I need to break these up, possibly even the functions themselves)
  - optionsMenu()     - (Used to select what function to run)
  - printCatalogue()  - (Runs through current vector list and displays them all on screen)
  - printCar()        - (Searches for car by index and displays on screen)
  - findCar()         - (Searches for car by index)(Returns pointer to car) **This is a function mostly called by other functions**
