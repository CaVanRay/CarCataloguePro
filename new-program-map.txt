This is the layout for the new CarCataloguePro, I'm going to plan out a cleaner more intuitive outline here before I just start opening files 

 ----- .CPP files -----

**main.cpp**:
  - main()            - starts and organizes everything

**menu.cpp** (might delete later):
  - optionsMenu()     - (Used to select what function to run) (need to simplify further)

**printer.cpp** (functions for printing and displaying?):
  - printCatalogue()  - (Runs through current vector list and displays them all on screen)
  - printCar()        - (Searches for car by index and displays on screen)

**toolFuncs.cpp** (functions used by other functions?):
  - findCar()         - (Searches for car by index)(Returns pointer to car) **This is a function mostly called by other functions**

**crudFuncs.cpp** (CRUD functions):
  - addCar()          - (Takes car info and then creates new object with input data)
  - repCar()		  - (Replaces one car with another) (NOT DONE)
  - editCar()         - (Searches for car by index, then allows user to edit existing data)
  - deleteCar()       - (Searches for car by index, then deletes data and releases resources)
  - moveCar()         - (Gets pointer to car using findCar() and then moves it up or down the linked list and updates the catalogue)

**Savld.cpp** (Save/Load functions):
  - saveCatalogue()   - (Saves current vector list of items to a txt file)
  - loadCatalogue()   - (Opens txt file of previous catalogue and populates new vector list with information in file)

**Validators.cpp** (Insures correct indexing after catalogue changes):
  - IndexUpdate()     - (Checks for errors & repairs index after each addition/removal of a catalogue item)
  - getInt()          - Validates int input
  - getDouble()       - Validates double input
  - getYN()           - Validates bool input
  - isValidVin()      - Validates VIN number input
  - getVIN()          - repeatedly asks for vin until valid
